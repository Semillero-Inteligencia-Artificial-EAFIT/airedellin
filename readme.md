**Airedell√≠n** is a repository initiated to promote citizen science in Medell√≠n, aiming to address the issue of air quality and PM2.5. The platform builds upon projects from citizen groups like Canairio and Unloquer, with a focus on visualizing and analyzing air quality data to improve public health.

## Project Overview

Medell√≠n experiences heightened PM2.5 levels, particularly during September and April-May. PM2.5 particles, which are 2.5 micrometers in diameter, come from unclean fuels and various sources like cooking, industrial activities, and vehicles. These fine particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream, posing severe health risks such as heart and lung diseases, strokes, and cancer. Winds from the Sahara also contribute to these increases.

Airedell√≠n leverages cutting-edge technologies to tackle this challenge and visualize air quality data, using:

- **Python** & **FastAPI**: For backend and API development.
- **JavaScript**: For frontend interactions.
- **Deck.gl** & **MapLibre**: For beautiful, responsive map visualizations.
- **Bootstrap**: For a sleek and modern UI.
- **InfluxDB**: For efficient data storage and querying.
- **CanAirIO**: Real-time air quality data provider for Medell√≠n.
- **Other libraris**: like Tensorflow, Xgboost ,Scikit-learn, Statsmodels



The platform includes machine learning models to analyze and predict air quality patterns based on historical data.

### Machine Learning Models and Algorithms

The following models are used to predict and analyze air quality trends:

- **Linear Regression**: Predicts the relationship between air quality and various factors.
- **ARIMA & SARIMA**: Time series models, suitable for data with temporal and seasonal patterns.
- **Random Forest**: Effective for complex problems with multiple variables.
- **Lasso**: Regularized linear regression, helpful for reducing model complexity.
- **XGBoost**: Powerful decision tree-based algorithm using boosting .
- **Exponential Smoothing**: For smooth time series data changes.
- **LSTM**: A recurrent neural network ideal for sequence-based data like air quality.
- **Exponential Smoothing**: For smooth changes over time.

some of this modeles are made for learning propuses

## Features

- **Map Visualization**: Airedell√≠n includes a real-time, interactive map displaying air quality data from various sensors across the city. Sensors are color-coded based on the data, and clicking on a sensor displays pop-ups with detailed information.
- **Heatmap**: Users can toggle a heatmap to visualize the intensity of PM2.5 concentrations across the city.
- **3D Relief**: Adds an extra visual layer to make the map more informative.
- **Predictions**: Predict air quality levels using machine learning models.
